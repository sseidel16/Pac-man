# ms-pac-man
These are the source files for my Ms Pac-Man program that I built in 2012.
I was young developer and very new to Java.
It was designed to behave almost exactly like the Ms Pac-Man arcade game but there are some algorithmic differences (I found this out later) especially with the ghosts and their pursuit.

## Boards
The boards are encoded in a made-up format and are similar, but not identical, to the real Ms Pac-Man boards.
The files can be found under resources/boards

## Images
The images are all designed using MS paint and the pixel pencil.
